# Ensure npm uses the correct permissions for bin scripts
# If you encounter permission errors, ensure your build environment:
# 1. Uses Node.js 20+ (see .nvmrc)
# 2. Has write permissions to node_modules
# 3. Runs npm install with appropriate user permissions

# For CI/CD environments with restricted permissions, you may need to:
# - Configure your deployment platform to use Node 20+
# - Ensure the build user has write access to the project directory
# - Consider using npm ci instead of npm install for more predictable builds
